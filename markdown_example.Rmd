# Set Up Session
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
setwd("~/Desktop/UpennCarpentry/UpennCarpentry")
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder.csv")
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, dplyr)
```

## R Markdown

Look I can doooo thingssss. This looks a bit nicer than the default.

```{r}
knitr::kable(summary(gapminder))
```

## Including Plots

**Look** _mom_ I am going to `ggplot` a thing.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  # Filter countries that start with "A" or "Z"
  filter(substr(country, start = 1, stop = 1) %in% c("A", "Z")) %>%
  # Make the plot
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ country)
```
